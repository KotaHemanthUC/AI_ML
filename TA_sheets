(a) The performance issue observed in 
the parallel region is false sharing. 
False sharing occurs when multiple 
threads or CPUs modify variables 
that reside on the same cache line, 
leading to unnecessary cache 
coherence traffic even though 
the variables themselves are not 
logically related. In this case, 
the variable partsumID is being 
updated by multiple threads 
concurrently, potentially 
causing false sharing due to cache line 
invalidations and updates.
